Objective : To determine the flakiness index of coarse aggregates

 Instruments and materials used: Sieve Shaker, flakiness index gauge, aggregates, sieves of following sizes- 25mm, 20mm, 16mm, 12.5mm, 10 mm and a pan.

 Step 1: Place the tray on the weighing balance. Press the TARE button and then measure the weight of the coarse aggregate sample.

 Step 2: Assemble the sieves in descending order with the largest aperture size sieve at the top and the smallest at the bottom. Place a pan below the bottom most sieve. 

 Step 2: Pour the aggregates into the sieve stack.

 Step 2: Cover the sieve stack with the lid and place it on the sieve shaker. Start the sieve shaker and wait for sometime.

 Step 2: Remove the sieves from the sieve shaker and note down the aggregates retained on each sieve. 

Step 3: Pass the aggregates retained on 25mm through the 40-25mm slot in the flakiness gauge. Separate the aggregate pieces which have passed the flakiness gauge from the ones that have not passed. 

 Step 3: Now, weigh the aggregates that have passed through the 40-25mm slot of flakiness gauge. 

 Step 4: Pass the aggregates that have retained on 20mm sieve one by one through the 25-20mm slot in flakiness gauge. Separate the  aggregates that have passed from the ones that have not passed the flakiness gauge. 

 Step 4: Weigh the aggregates that have passed through the 25-20mm slot on flakiness gauge.


 Step 5: Try passing the aggregates through the 20-16mm slot in the flakiness gauge. Separate the passing aggregates form the ones that have not passed. 

 Step 5: Weigh the aggregates that have passed through the 20-16mm slot in flakiness gauge. 

 Step 6: Pass the aggregates through the 16-12.5mm slot in the flakiness gauge.

 Step 6:  Weigh the aggregates that have passed through the 16-12.5mm slot

 Step 7: Now, Pass the aggregates through the 12.5-10mm slot in the flakiness gauge 

 Step 7: Weigh the aggregates that have passed through the 12.5-10mm slot 

 Step 8: Pass the aggregates through the 10-6.3mm slot in flakiness gauge 

 Step 8: Weigh the aggregates passing through the 10-6.3mm slot.
