### Theory

1. The flakiness index of aggregate is defined as the percentage by weight of
the particles of aggregate whose least dimension is less than 0.6 of their
mean dimension.
2. During the construction of roads, flaky particles are considered
undesirable because they get broken easily upon the application of load.
This may result in the failure of roads with the development of cracks
over their surface. Thus, it is necessary to find out the flakiness value of
aggregates to account for their suitability in concrete structures and
highway construction.
3. The flakiness index should be less than 15% during pavement
construction and normally it should not exceed 25% .
